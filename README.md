# AlgoAscend 🚀

## Intent
This repository is my space to document consistent progress in Data Structures & Algorithms.  
Every commit here is proof of practice, growth, and the discipline to climb higher, step by step.

## Purpose
- Build a strong foundation in DSA through regular problem-solving.  
- Sharpen problem-solving patterns that can be applied in real-world scenarios.  
- Track and showcase my journey, not just the results.  

## Structure
- **/arrays** → Problems & solutions on arrays.  
- **/strings** → String manipulation and related challenges.  
- **/linked-lists** → Implementations and problem sets.  
- **/stacks-queues** → Stack, Queue, and variations.  
- **/trees** → Binary Trees, BSTs, traversals, etc.  
- **/graphs** → Graph algorithms and applications.  
- **/dp** → Dynamic Programming patterns.  
- **/misc** → Other challenges, experiments, and notes.
